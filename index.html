        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>

        <p class="about-p-1">
            My name is Austin Stamps.  I am 29 years old and live outside of Asheville North Carolina
            in a small argricultural town called Barnardsville.  I have worked previously in several industries 
            including Challenge Course Operation and Construction, Food Service both as back of house and front 
            of house, Retail Sales and working under a General Contractor framing houses and small barns. 
        </p>

        <p class="about-p-2">
            I enjoyed all of these positions and had many opportunities to speak with and 
            meet the web developers and emplyees of agencies that advertised for the respective company 
            I was employed by.  I realized that these people were the backbone of these buisnesses, without a funtionaing and well
            designed website and without online advertising the buisness would not have near the profit or 
            reputation it current had.  It was at this point that I fell in love with this line of work 
            and decided to pursue it in my personal career.
